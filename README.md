Lab07

Data Structures

(a) Before starting the lab, go to GitHub by using your account and create your private repositories called CS102_lab07. Whenever you are done with one of the following parts of the lab you will need to add all of your changes, commit them and push them to the remote repository. Make sure that your repositories are indeed private because if they are not then anyone on the web will be able to copy your homework, which will get you into trouble.


For every part of the lab, you should have at least one commit that has a clear message of what was implemented in that commit and for which part.


(b) Implement a Node class that you will use in the following parts of the lab that will contain attributes: data and next. For this lab, you can assume that data will be of type String. Next will obviously be a node as well.


(c) Implement the SimpleLinkedList class as specified below. Write a test class that demonstrates its use, e.g. create a list, add a number of strings to it, print the entire list, get items at various index locations within the list, and remove items from it one-by-one, each time printing it out again. Note: get( index) should return null if no such index exists. Don't forget that your linked list will consist of the nodes, you implemented in part a.

public class SimpleLinkedList
public SimpleLinkedList()
public void addToTail(String data)
public String removeFromHead()
public boolean isEmpty()
public Node get(String data)
public String toString()
(d) Using the SimpleLinkedList class, create a SimpleQueue class, which has only the standard enqueue(String data) that add data into queue dequeue() that remove data from queue and isEmpty() methods, and a constructor to create an empty queue.

(e) Now that you have implemented Queue we can use it to make Ð° stack by using 2 Queues. Create SimpleStackWithQueue class having only push(String data), pop() , toString() methods.



Hint. For example, you can use the following method
push(x) // x is the element to be pushed

1) Enqueue x to q2

2) One by one dequeue everything from q1 and enqueue to q2.

3) Swap the names of q1 and q2

// Swapping of names is done to avoid one more movement of all elements

// from q2 to q1.



pop(s)

1) Dequeue an item from q1 and return it.
